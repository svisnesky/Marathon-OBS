"""Detection benchmark — measures how fast the OCR pipeline actually runs on
this machine, on demand (no game/session needed).

It OCRs a representative popup-sized frame N times through the real OCREngine
(same upscale + size cap as live detection) and reports average latency,
throughput, the compute device (GPU/CPU), and VRAM in use. The dashboard
surfaces this in the DETECTION panel and behind the BENCHMARK button.
