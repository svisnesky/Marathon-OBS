"""Capture diagnostic — shows EXACTLY what WITNESS is looking at.

Run this (or double-click "Diagnose Capture.bat") with Marathon on screen —
ideally with a RUNNER DOWN / PRECISION DOWN popup visible (pause on a clip or
a kill cam if you can). It:

  1. prints your real capture settings (source, region, monitor/cam),
  2. saves TWO images next to the app:
       diagnose_full.png    - the whole frame WITNESS receives
       diagnose_region.png  - the cropped area it actually reads for popups
  3. runs OCR on that crop and prints what it read, and whether that would
     have counted as a kill.

Then open the two images. The answer is almost always one of:
  - diagnose_full.png is black / wrong screen  -> capture source is wrong
       (OBS Virtual Camera not started, or wrong monitor).
  - diagnose_region.png doesn't sit over where the popup appears
       -> the detect region needs recalibrating.
  - region looks right but OCR read nothing -> no popup was on screen in
       this frame (retry with one visible), or OCR needs tuning.
